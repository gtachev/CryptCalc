# CryptoCalc
Simple cryptocurrency calculator <br />
It is pretty raw material at this point, I'm mostly using it for my own needs. <br />
To use it just download it and edit the 'has' variable. <br />
I keep it as a single file so I can just copy it on my smartphone. <br />
Any pull requests are appreciated, keep it fun :) <br />
You can see preview with sample data (http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/gtachev/CryptoCalc/blob/master/crypto-calc.html "here")
